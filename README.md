The best way to build and run this solution is using Visual Studio, you can download a free version from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), you can also run it from command line interface, please check necessary commands [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/cli-create-console-app), in addition, there are more details available at dotnet core guidance [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/), you can also run and debug it just by using supported text editor, I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). And, you need to install .net core SDK (includes runtime as well) from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1) For example; if you're running it from command line:-

Open Terminal or Command Prompt and go to the root folder of the solution, then
